# We Needed Chairs

We needed chairs and other essential items for our new flat in Barcelona. The problem arises when you go to the department store website, or even google search "chair"; you get maybe half the results, all from the sites that go the extra-mile to add keywords in English. If you search the same results, but query 'silla' instead, truly better and ranked results near me show.
