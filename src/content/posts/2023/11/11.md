# Exploring Playgrounds Cont.
With such amazing parks and playgrounds here, sometimes a Saturday game plan is to pick a new park we have to travel a bit to. This "Pulpo Park" is on the H6 bus at the other end of the line, we just needed to catch it in front of our door.

 We packed a picnic basket of treats, so we explored the wider garden and distracted Nora away from the playground area until we were fed.

Senior Pulpo si mismo. Each arm was a slide of varying complexity and height. Nora went up but had also been experiencing a little slide PTSD. She got stuck up there because she didn't want to go down herself. This freaked me out because being 6'3", I was not climbing in there. Luckily- Barcelona is for the kids. A swarm of kids Nora's age noticed her upset and helped coached her down. All is well.
