# Birthday Shenanigans

Took Monday off this weekend, for birthday shenanigans recovery. Recovery ended up taking the form of roof deck food truck tacos... so jump to the bottom for that!

## Fri

Playgrounds and work to ease into the weekend.

## Sat

Margarita crawl! with a 3 year old XD. We also blew up balloons, made a banner, and had a dance party. Nora was surprisingly good at blowing up the balloons but no hope for tying it so she would send them flying throughout the flat. We went to the mall to procure supplies. I ended up with a dulce de leche filled donut that was ginormous. I can still feel the sugar burning the back of my skull. On our way to the mall, Nora visited her electrical box with an airplane on it, exclaiming we are in Barcelona because of an airplane and she can't wait to go airplane again! [mom and dad can wait....]
