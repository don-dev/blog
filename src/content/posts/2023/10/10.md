# Barcelona is Food

The food scene here is incredible! I hope this intro sheds light into why we have been slow to get rolling; but also offer some insight into the day-to-day meals here.

Not to bury the lead; we tested positive for covid 2 days after landing lol. Something was immediately off. I had zero appetite for the good things- even water tasted off to me. Lucky for us, contactless delivery is well figured out here; and a service entrance through a back elevator is even more of a plus. So, any plans to land and celebrate with food or *moving* were quickly replaced with all day sofa bed and ramen noodles.

## Take Out

Glovo, Uber Eats are only half the equation; if it's not listed on these, chances are they do take away if you are able to head over. I'm embarrassed to share what we delivered the first few days. I will however share the better side of take out in later posts; the options can be stellar. But nothing beats going out and experiencing tapas or other IRL.

## Tapas

*"It's actually pronounced tay-pas, Jen" - Moss*

Since our migration journey- I have failed to actually take photos of any tapas. It's a lot of things really- covid certainly didn't help; as we were stuck at home. And then when we were negative, *nothing* tasted right.

It feels disingenuous to reach into my photos from years ago and blog about it like that is what is happening now. I promise, the time is coming when I will start to catalog real escapades out to the tapas bars as a local- what our favorites are, and hopefully some names and pictures to match.

What is really happened, actually feels more settling- I'm cooking again! Something I love to do, and not doing due to 4 months of transition and boxes.

## Cooking

I mentioned recipes would show up here! Today's is just a throw in. We have been making quick and easy meals; that doesn't mean they can't be *amazing.* I have been making us honey dijon salmon, carne asada steak tacos, lamb with my own potatoes bravas and this gem: Mussels with linguine and artichoke.

I knew I would be cooking again. It has been months of couch crashing with folks (i'm not allowed to use the kitchen or make dinner there). I used to cook often at the Kingston house. FYI- I brought my sourdough starter here (*to be continued...*). I am most pleased with the market offerings in my immediate vicinity.
### The Grocery

Around us, are oh so many options; each great for different things.

- Neighborhood markets: each 'borough has a public market with vendors for fish/meat/cheese'. Usually, multiple vendors for each option. I love seeing the mounds of ice and fresh fish.
- Organic Stores: Dylan or Ametller Origen... plus countless of nameless produce vendors- it's option fatigue until I find one store for each fruit/veg/fish
- CondisLIFE: This is basics, but cheap- don't raise an eyebrow; even their fresh fish is a sight to behold

Time to discuss beber: Not uncommon for us to find a 2EUR wine that is a steal. Orpha tip? If you don't know what to pick; look for the product that is noticeably short (that's what everyone else is grabbing).

The settling in and cooking everything has been a source of joy. My lunch today was a cup of noodles with King Prawns that I added. Side note- if you are still pouring hot water over your ramen- smh; you should consider adding your own ingredients, stir-frying, and dropping a tea egg in there.... *what are you new?!*.

## A New Tradition: Desayuno (breakfast AKA brikybraky)

We just started dropping off at school, 8:45. We walk there and there are a million cafes and bakery along the way. Yes, I have perfected the cafe con leche at home with the moka pot and stovetop milk steamer/frother- but we want to explore Barcelona!

After we drop Nora off, we pick a new cafe to hit up. We sit, get coffee and usually a sweet or a Bocadillo (common sandwich / usually with jamon). So far- the food has been gone before I could get a picture. I think I will end this first food focused post with just snapshots of what I remembered and could pic before it was too late.

Truly, stay tuned for more posts on food.
