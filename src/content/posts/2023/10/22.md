description: New expat friends told us 5EUR to go here and their little one has been there 12 times since arriving. So happy and would echo their endorsement, this is absolutely the place to go.

## The hill

The walk up was brilliant in it's own right.
We pass by the church square with vistas up the montain of tibadabo
Residential

## Mysterious Entrance

It's obvious you are at the right building, but who doesn't love a windy path up over a massive glass enclosed rainforest exhibit.

## Fish Here Too

I have mentioned Nora's love for the aquarium- this place had the best all encompassing exhibit of fish, plant, and mammals.

## Lookout Boston Science Museum

Boston Science is a favorite but we were hesitant to take Nora- this had the perfect amount of buttons to press that kept her engaged right until nap time.

## Adult Night

Orpha and I kept fantasing about coming back after dropping Nora off at school- *that fun*.
