# SHAME!
I'm going to keep this real lite; turns out I had pneumonia!

We went to Girona! This was the view from my death bed, which I stayed 90% of the time...:

The apartment location and overall style was amazing.

Girona is beautiful.

Nora had a craftbox activity and she made these wings with it. They stayed on the remainder of the trip.

I did manage one walk- Orpha showed me the GoT church. I need to come back with better health.
