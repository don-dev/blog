# Surprise! Roof.

We have an atrium section of our flat where there is a terrace facing inwards (column of flats facing in with an exposed ceiling); the washing machine is out on this side. Looking out and up reveals other appartments solutions for drying their laundry. A lot of terraces have bolted to the railing, cloths lines. Orpha wanted some for our terrace, missing this component- and the doorman said there is a clothsline on the roof.
...
*We had no idea there was roof access*
..
Queue the rest of the afternoon doing the linens and checking out the view.

## Treat Yo Self

And with a days chores complete, we walked down to [El Nacional](https://www.elnacionalbcn.com/) in [L'Eixample](https://ajuntament.barcelona.cat/eixample/es "Inicio"), where I scarfed down 12 oysters.
