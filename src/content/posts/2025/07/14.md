# Moving off x11 | And POP!_OS

I finally did it! I have been using x11 really because I was POP!_OS and i3wm all the way. Because I customize everything so intensely, I felt locked in. I was super familiar with my curated environment and lived in stable bliss for so long. My main compy is a System76 laptop with hybrid NVIDIA graphics. System76 has a vested interest in the OS and drivers woorking with NVIDIA with 0 issues. I thought one needed to be loco to leave this behind.

## COSMIC DESKTOP and the rise of Wayland defaults

POP had announced COSMIC desktop and the new version of POP!_OS was going to be Wayland by default. I was skeptical, but I had to try it. I installed the latest version of POP!_OS and booted into COSMIC. The first thing I noticed was how smooth everything felt. The animations were snappy, and the overall performance was impressive. What is extra cool about this shift; Ubuntu, Fedora, and others have announced they are dropping support of x11 and or making Wayland a default. To me, this meant the tide is turning and my days of stability were coming to a close. Get with the new or get off the pipeline.

## Garuda Linux and Hyprland

I learned linux on Arch. I had the usual newbie experience trying to install Arch by sitting with a printed out version of the install guide but if you know you know... I was not much better at understanding what the commands I was copying and pasting meant. I have installed arch since, (and others). I have a much better understanding of what everything means and why. Why you would separate your root partition, or WHY you would swp or no swp. I still wanted an opinionated flavor of Arch with hyprland that was known to be OK with the NVIDIA drivers I needed to configure. Garuda offers an easy GUI installer that makes it a breeze for seasoned and novice users alike.
