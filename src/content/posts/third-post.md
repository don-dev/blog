### Chapter Complete!

The family all packed up and flew to UK to attend my sisters' graduation. I mentioned to another, 'I think this is the easiest graduation ceremony we have done'. "Flying overseas?!?! With Kids?!?!"

That's not quite how I meant it. The ceramony was so easy- the three of us were able to sit in a lecture hall that was 25% capacity; with the event streaming on the hall's screens. It was fast and easy. I loved bringing Nora to England. Orpha used to live and work here. I have also spent a good amount of time, and both of us were anxious to hit the fun spots on our list, and share these experiences with Nora.
