## An Organized Chaos

We had left our house and were staying with the folks while performing a complicated dance with a storage locker. Our complete lives, boxed and organized, taking up nearly the complete space. From back to front; we organized what would stay in storage, what would ship to Dominican Republic, what *eventually* would take to Spain, and what immediately we would take to Spain. That last bucket looked like 8 large suitecases. We went that route as it was cheaper than shipping to Spain and dealing with port authority.

### FOR SALE

I mentioned some items going to Dominican Republic- we have a half caulked idea about owning a property there, and renting it out for the time we are not. With so much family there; it seems to make sense. It also seems like a hot market we can step in on. Another place to drop keys, and maintain the items we have been collecting. After visiting and working with a brooker- i'm less optimistic. Orpha and I are more into the possibility of someone we know needing good heirloom pieces of furniture. I plan on posting a catalogue of it here.
